# Ticket_category_pred

Project description

This case study shows how to create a model for text analysis and classification 

What will you find inside:

-How to clean and prepare text data and featurize it to make it valuable for machine learning scenarios

-How to strip the data from any sensitive information and also anonymize/encrypt it

-How to create a classification model using Python modules like: sklearn, nltk, matplotlib, pandas
